# connect

## Plan:
- Web-/App where everyone has an area in every location and can chat without making a group or exchanging number or usernames...
- user can filter their area for male/female, age, verified
- users can see other users in their specific area and also other areas that are available at their location....
- users can subscribe to areas to still being able to chat even when they move away from them...
- users can connect/follow/friendship with other users and chat privately...
- later user can connect via near-bluetooth
- the areas need to know which users are in them...
- go backend using R-tree or better R*-tree cause fast
- App und Web in flutter cause 3-in-1
- maybe later 1 infrastructure project with "just" command runner to build it in Kubernetes with multiple pods and also pipelines to build the images and run tests...
