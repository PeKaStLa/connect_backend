# connect

## Plan:
- Web-/App where everyone has a community in every location and can chat without making a group or exchanging number or username and 
- user can filter their area for male/female, age, verified
- go backend using R-tree or better R*-tree cause fast
- App und Web in flutter cause 3-in-1
- later user can connect via near-bluetooth
- maybe later 1 infrastructure project with "just" command runner to build it in Kubernetes with multiple pods and also pipelines to build the images and run tests...
